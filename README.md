# DNA Alignment: User's Manual

## [Video Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/xPMsahcAv24)

## Overview

I coded a program that enables biologists to score the similarity between DNA sequences and view the aligned portions. Given DNA sequences as [input](#input), the program [outputs](#output) a numerical and visual representation of their alignment.

It does this by implementing two algorithms for DNA alignment: the [Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignment](DESIGN.md#needleman-wunsch-algorithm-for-global-alignment) and the [Smith-Waterman algorithm for local alignment](DESIGN.md#smith-waterman-algorithm-for-local-alignment). I describe both in detail in the [algorithms](DESIGN.md#algorithms) section of my [design document](DESIGN.md). The main takeaways are that one can either try to align two DNA sequences over all their nucleotides using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm or look for portions of the inputted sequences that are closely aligned using the Smith-Waterman algorithm.

After [getting ready to to test my code](#set-up), try out its two methods of use: its [graphical user interface (GUI)](#gui) or [command-line interface (CLI)](#cli). I describe how to use both in detail in their respective sections.

## Input & Output

### Input

The user inputs two or more DNA sequences as their standard string representations, where `A` represents the nucleotide adenine, `T` represents thymine, `C` represents cytosine, and `G` represents guanine. For example, `GATTCGACGC` is a sample input  sequence with 10 nucleotides with two adenines, two thymines, three cytosines, and three guanines.

Depending on how the user is interacting with the program, they will seperate each input sequence with either a single space or a newline. If the user is uploading a file as input, it must have the `.CSV` extension (case insensitive) and have each sequence on a newline with no other seperators.

### Output

Depending on the number of sequences the user inputs, the program will produce a different number of sets of outputs. The program produces one set of outputs for each combinations of two inputted sequences: for example, with `A`, `T`, and `C` as inputs, the combinations are {`A`, `T`}, {`A`, `C`}, and {`T`, `C`}, and each of the three combinations produces its own set of ouputs. Each set of outputs consists of the following:
* **Global Alignment 1**: this is the string representation of a DNA sequence, potentially with gaps (represented by hyphens, `-`). It is an alteration of the first inputted sequence (with all the same nucleotides in the same order) with gaps inserted to increase its overall alignment with the second inputted sequence of the pair.
* **Global Alignment 2**: this is the string representation of the second inputted sequence aligned with gaps to the first.
* **Global Alignment Score**: this is an integer (positive or negative) that represents how similar the two sequences are when aligned.
* **Local Alignment 1**: it is part or all of the first inputted sequence (with all the same nucleotides in the same order) with gaps inserted to increase its alignment with part or all of the second inputted sequence of the pair.
* **Local Alignment 2**: this is the string representation of part or all of the second inputted sequence aligned with gaps to the first.
* **Local Alignment Score**: this is a positive integer that represents how similar the aligned portions of the two sequences are.

## Set-Up

To prepare to test the program:
1. Download the distribution code of the program
2. Upload the distribution code to Visual Studio Code (VSCode) or [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/)
3. Open a terminal window
4. Navigate to the root directory of my project called `/dna-alignment` using `cd`
5. Continue to the [GUI](#gui) or [CLI](#cli) section for instructions on how to use each respectively

***

## GUI

I created a website for my program to make the user experience more pleasant. It enables people from non-technical backgrounds to use the program and easily visualize its execution.

### Steps
6. Run `flask run` in the terminal
7. Click on the link that is printed to the console to navigate to the webpage, where you should see the words "DNA Alignment".
8. Click on the "Manual Input" radio button and try out the test cases marked as "Manual" listed below
9. Click on the "Upload CSV" file and try out the test cases marked as "CSV" listed below
10. Press the "Download Resuls" button to download an SQLite3 database of results
11. Press the "Sort by: Global Score ▼" button to sort the database so that rows with lower global scores show up top
12. Press the "Sort by: Global Score ▲" button to sort the database so that rows with higher global scores show up top
13. Press the "Sort by: Local Score ▼" button to sort the database so that rows with lower local scores show up top
14. Press the "Sort by: Local Score ▲" button to sort the database so that rows with higher local scores show up top
15. Press the "Sort by: Time ▼" button to sort the database so that rows created longer ago show up top
16. Press the "Sort by: Time ▲" button to sort the database so that rows created more recently show up top

### Test Cases

To validate the exact global and local alignment sequences and scores that the inputted sequences produce, feel free to use the Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman tools linked in the [resources section](#resources) with a match score of 1, mismatch score of -1, and gap score of -2, as is standard.

| Type | Input | Expected Output | Explaination | Purpose |
| ---- | ----- | --------------- | ------------ | ------- |
| Manual Input | `ATCG` and `ATTG` on seperate lines in the input field, then press "Submit" | One new row | The two inputted sequences are valid | Simple test case |

| Manual Input | `ATCG` then press "Submit" | `At least two valid DNA sequences are required` | Only one valid input was provided | Proves that the program can handle errors |
| CSV | Upload `app.py` | "Submit" button doesn't show up | `app.py` is not a valid CSV file | Proves that the program can prevent errors |
| CSV | Upload `test.csv`, then press "Submit" | 190 new rows | 20 of the 26 inputted sequences are valid | Proves that the program can handle many test cases |

## CLI

I initially intended for my program to only have a CLI and no GUI. The CLI is good for program testing purposes and a quicker processing time.

### Steps
6. Run `python3 main.py help`, `python3 main.py --help`, `python3 main.py h`, or `python3 main.py -h` in the terminal. This will output to the console instructions on how to use the program:
```console
~/dna-alignment$ python3 main.py help
Usage:
python3 main.py sequence1 sequence2  # Command-line inputs
python3 main.py filename.csv         # CSV file input
python3 main.py                      # Interactive inputs
```
7. Try out the test cases marked by "Command-Line" listed below
8. Try out the test cases marked by "CSV" listed below
9. Try out the test cases marked by "Interactive" listed below
10. Try out the unit test cases marked by "Unit Tests" listed below

### Test Cases
